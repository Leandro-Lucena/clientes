# Customer Management System

[üáßüá∑ Em Portugu√™s](README.br.md)

## ‚ú® The Project

A customer registration application built with a React + TypeScript frontend and a Node.js + PostgreSQL backend. The system allows authenticated login, customer registration, editing, and listing, with an option to export a list of all customers to PDF. Authentication is used to protect routes, and Docker was used to containerize the application.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

### Frontend:

- React + TypeScript
- Material UI
- React Router
- react-pdf (PDF generation)
- Jest (unit tests)

### Backend:

- Node.js + TypeScript
- Express
- TypeORM
- PostgreSQL
- JWT for authentication and route protection

### DevOps:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## üìå API - Available Backend Endpoints (port 5000)

### Authentication:

```

‚Üí Body: { username: string, password: string }
‚Üí Return: token JWT
```

### Clients (protegido com JWT):

```
GET /clients
‚Üí Lists all clients

POST /clients
‚Üí Creates a new client
‚Üí Body: { name, email, phone, address }

PUT /clients/:id
‚Üí Updates an existing client
‚Üí Body: { name, email, phone, address }

DELETE /clients/:id
‚Üí Removes an existing client
```
